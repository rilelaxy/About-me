            <h3>Rosie and Rover</h3>
            <p>I got my cats in December 2020, they are brother and sister.<br>
            <strong>They really helped me get through the last 3 years.</strong><br>
                Rosie's name is actually a nickname, her full name is Rosalina after the Mario character.<br>
                Rover is named after Rover from the Animal Crossing series.<br>
                Their names start with R to match my brother and I, Riley and River.<br>
                Rover is like a clumsy gentlemen and rosie is a polite fancy cat.<br>
                Despite looking completly different they do infact come from the same family.<br>
                Rover is a shorthair tuxedo cat and will meow at you until you pet him.<br>
                Rosie is extremly fluffy and affectionate, <i>always</i> wanting to cuddle.<br>

        <h3>Big Dreams!</h3>
        <p>As you can tell from my favorites section, I <strong>really love Nintendo</strong>.<br>
            When I was 3 years old, I recieved my first console, a DS Lite.<br>
            I played it everyday even though I couldn't read, it always made me feel passionate and happy.<br>
            That is when I was <strong>inspired</strong> to provide the same joy to other kids.<br>
            This sounds absurd, but I told my mom at 3 that I wanted to be CEO of Nintendo of America.<br>
            As I got older, I began working hard to <strong>reach my goal</strong>, and found that I love game design, especially UX and narrative design.<br>
            I have never once doubted it is what I want to do, and what I will do.<br>
            I want to help others, the same way others have helped me.<br>
            Wether that's through video games, creating policies with the city, or even just spending time with my friends.<br>
            It's what I consider my life purpose, and it brings me happiness everyday. I love what I do.<br>
            I have been confident in that since I could think.
